# fastpy

A high-performance Python extension for numpy arrays with optional CUDA support.

This repository contains the native extension sources (C++/CUDA) and Python bindings built with pybind11.

## Highlights

- Native C++ & CUDA implementation for fast array operations
- Python bindings via pybind11

## Prerequisites

- Python
- Visual Studio
- CMake
- CUDA Toolkit
- pip

## How To Use

Run the following from the repository root:

	py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
	py -m build

## Run

After a successful build the Python extension module is produced under the build output (for example `build/Release/fastpy.cp312-win_amd64.pyd` or in `Release/`). To run the example:

	py -m main
